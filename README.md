# React + Vite + Adobe XD


Hello my lovely nerds !
I'm currently working on a mobility app for Accenture (for school actually).

There's no specific rules excpet basic stuff, like a different interface for user or HR so I can do whatever I want.

In the future i'd like to built it in React Native, wich I have to learn first.. 

Here's a link where you can see a glimpse of the "final" product. I'll upload the full (and working) prototype made with Adobe XD later on Dribbble and Behance, but first let's write some code.

Enjoy.
